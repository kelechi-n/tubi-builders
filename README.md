# Tubi Builder Program Code Sample
Hello, thank you for checking out my project. There are two files, "ASL_Classifier.ipynb" and "ASL_Kelechi.ipynb", The "ASL_Classifier.ipynb" file contains the full project, and the "ASL_Kelechi.ipynb" file contains only the models that I created.

In case anyone would like more information on the project, I've linked the google doc to view the full report: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NXI-JKiijN4wehpn6nSYmwt01nqUJwSADrr5_Sa9jpU/edit?tab=t.0

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to create a model that can recognize the ASL alphabet letter. This model will be trained to identify the alphabet letter when given an image of a hand signing a letter. This project will use the Sign Language MNIST dataset from Kaggle.

## Problem Statement
Communication and socialization is a key part of the human experience. Being able to communicate with others is needed in order to form relationships, transfer information, and connect to others. However, learning new languages is not something that is possible or accessible to everyone. While ASL is much more complicated than just stringing together letters of the alphabet, creating a model that can accurately classify the ASL alphabet is a great first step to creating a much larger model that can understand more ASL and allow for more people to communicate with those that use ASL.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the 26 letters of the ASL alphabet. This model can be built on at a later point in time to recognize other words in ASL. But at this current moment, the model can be used as a starting point to make communication easier between those who use ASL and those who are not familiar with it.
